""" matcher.py

    People commit typos, it's natural. Sometimes they just don't know how to
    write the name of the movie correctly, but they try. And there are users
    that can't guess correctly and throw some other movie.

    This Match class is responsible for comparing two strings based on the
    similarity score from 0 to 100 percent between the official movie title
    in English and the comment that the person sent.

    Byte comparison in these kinds of game is HORRIBLE. They take it too
    literally, and if you miss one letter, they give a false negative.
